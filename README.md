# DGH
This repository provides the code for **Data Generation for Hardware-Friendly Post-Training Quantization (DGH)**. , a method designed to improve model performance in zero-shot quantization. By optimizing synthetic data and enhancing quantization accuracy, DGH helps streamline the deployment of fully quantized models..
